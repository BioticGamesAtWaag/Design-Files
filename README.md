# Design-Files

Laser cutting files (svg and dxf) for the biotic game device, including
- mini aquariums (a.k.a. microscope slides)
- device design (cut in MDF)

Notes:
- Sometimes the .dxf file scale wrongly on the lasercutter software. 
- If needed, check the dimensions (mm) in the .svg file in Inkscape and resize
